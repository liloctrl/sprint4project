# Vehicle Data Analysis

This project provides an interactive data visualization tool using Streamlit and Plotly Express, designed for exploring vehicle data. The tool includes histograms and scatter plots to visualize relationships between price, odometer readings, and model year, making it easier to analyze trends and patterns in vehicle data.

## Features

- **Histograms** for exploring distributions (e.g., vehicle price distribution).
- **Scatter plots** for examining relationships between variables (e.g., price vs. odometer).
- **Interactive controls** using Streamlit, allowing users to toggle between different plots and visualizations.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and loading data.
- **Plotly Express**: For creating interactive, web-based plots.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web-based user interface, enabling interactivity and easy sharing.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/liloctrl/sprint4project.git
   cd vehicle-data-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. *Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open in browser**:
   Once the app is running, a local URL will be provided in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`). Open this link in your browser to view the tool.

## Usage

1. Start the app**: Launch with `streamlit run app.py`.
2. Explore data**: Use the checkbox and different visualizations to interactively explore vehicle data.
